On July 16, the members of the MODX team were notified that an example attack script was shared publicly that would enable hackers to modify and use for malicious purposes. Starting on July 18th, 2018, the MODX team began receiving reports that these attacks were compromising MODX Revolution websites. <br />
<br />
<strong>Upgrade Now</strong><br />
If your site has not been hacked, you <strong>MUST upgrade</strong>* to MODX Revolution 2.6.5 and all Extras immediately. <br />
<br />
<strong>Already Hacked</strong><br />
If your site has been compromised, do not panic. It may be possible to recover the site if you have a backup from prior to July 18th, 2018. <br />
<br />
Once you have restored from a backup, you should immediately upgrade to MODX Revolution 2.6.5 and then upgrade all Extras from within the MODX Manager, including Gallery if it is installed. Once you login to your site Manager (e.g., at <a href="https://www.example.com/manager/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.example.com/manager/</a>), navigate to the top &quot;Extras&quot; menu and press the orange &quot;upgrade&quot; button for each Extra that needs to be upgraded.<br />

Most MODX users and site owners will have no issues with PHP 7 if they run at least MODX 2.5.2 or Evo CMS 1.4.0 (formerly MODX Evolution) or later versions.

<a href="https://modx3.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX3.org</a> was recently deployed to celebrate the official launch of the MODX3 Project. A dedicated team is currently working on making MODX3 a reality. Some familiar names from the MODX Community are pushing the project forward on a daily basis including Vasily Naumkin, Mark Hamstra, Gauke Pieter Sietzema, and myself. The very talented UX designer Rinze van der Brug is providing additional support. We are also getting help from members of the community and the MODX integration team.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Plan</strong><br />
For a complete plan of MODX3, please check the <a href="https://modx3.org/plan" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">website</a>. It contains a list of prospective features which we will continue to update with any additional ones we come up with as the project progresses. We are reserving budget for extra features, and we will publish examples of these as part of the <a href="https://modx3.org/updates" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">weekly updates on MODX3.org</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>You Can Contribute to MODX3</strong><br />
STERC, MODX LLC, modmore, and a subsidy from the European Union (European Fund for Regional Development) are subsidizing the MODX3 project. The full budget is available <a href="https://modx3.org/funding" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br />
<br />
However, three companies cannot entirely fund a project of this size on their own. Therefore, we are seeking additional funding from sponsors and donations. These funds will be utilized to finish the project and enable us to implement extra features in MODX3, to make it even better!<br />
<br />
Sponsors can <a href="https://modx3.org/sponsor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">submit the sponsor form</a> and will get an invoice from STERC who is acting as a financial intermediary of the project. We are not defining standard packages, but any amount above € 100,- will help. We will provide optional recognition for all sponsors in a future sponsor listing. Sponsors paying over € 2.500,- can also display their logo on the project website.<br />
<br />
Recognition on the site is also available now for those wishing to <a href="https://modx3.org/donate" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">donate to the project immediately</a>. After submitting the donation form, you can select from the following payment methods: PayPal, iDEAL, Bancontact, SOFORT Banking, bank transfer, KBC/CBC Payment Button, ING HomePay, and credit card.<br />

The MODXpo will be held at 210 METROV, where the hugely successful 2015 MODX Meetup was held. This year, the main room will be 200 square metres with separate rooms for workshops!<br />
<br />
<strong>Day 1: Talks</strong><br />
The first day of MODXpo 2017 will be a full day of talks, presented by MODX community members including Greame Leighfield, Vasily Naumkin, Ivan Klimchuk and Gauke Pieter Sietzema. See the <a href="https://2017.modxpo.eu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the full schedule</a>. There are still some spots to fill, so please <a href="https://t.me/modxpo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">contact the organizers</a> if you’ve got something up your sleeve!<br />
<br />
<strong>Day 2: Workshops</strong><br />
The second day will be packed with workshops. Munich’s MODXpo workshops were well received. We’re sure these will be a hit in Minsk.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tickets</strong><br />
The ticket price has been set at 99BYN (see in <a href="http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=99&amp;From=BYN&amp;To=EUR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EUR</a>, <a href="http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=99&amp;From=BYN&amp;To=USD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">USD</a> and <a href="http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=99&amp;From=BYN&amp;To=GBP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GPB</a>). You’ll get two days full of MODX goodness, including food throughout the day, a tour through Minsk and of course a goodie-bag. Also, expect most of the community heading to a bar together after each day to relax and enjoy some local drinks.<br />

<strong>Getting to Minsk</strong><br />
A lot of Western European and US citizens haven’t visited Belarus yet and might be hesitant to do so. Our MODX-friends from <a href="https://www.sterc.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sterc</a> have traveled the whole continent for MODX Meetups—including Kazakhstan and Belarus. <br />
<br />
Sterc’s Gauke Pieter has this to say about their trip to Belarus: <br />
<br />
<blockquote>“Traveling to Minsk was as easy as traveling to Munich: flying from Amsterdam with a decent airplane, landing on a really neat airport and traveling to our Minsk city center Hotel was a breeze. <br />
    The taxis we used all had WiFi, which was really useful. If you don’t like taxis: there’s a very good subway. The hotel had high standards and beautiful big rooms. The best part: the people from Belarus are very kind and helpful.” <br />

<strong>Upgrading Is Critical</strong><br />
<br />

<br />
We cannot stress the importance of diligently upgrading to the latest version of MODX enough. While no software is 100% secure, powering your site with the most current version usually helps protect you from hackers that rely on exploiting outdated software. If you’re not sure what version of MODX Revolution you’re running, log into your website Manager. If the version number doesn’t appear in the top left-hand corner of the Manager, go to <em>Manage&gt;Reports&gt;System Info</em>.<br />

<strong>Upgrading Is Critical</strong> <br />
We cannot stress the importance of diligently upgrading to the latest version of MODX enough. While no software is 100% secure, powering your site with the most current version usually helps protect you from hackers that rely on exploiting outdated software. If you’re not sure what version of MODX Evolution you’re running, login to your website Manager and it should be in the upper right hand corner—possibly left, if extremely old. <br />
<br />
If you need help upgrading your site, please contact your website builder, find a <a href="https://modx.com/professionals/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Professional</a> or get in touch with <a href="https://modx.com/services/#engage" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Support</a>. <br />

<strong>Important Note for TinyMCE Users</strong> <br />
<br />
We have found an issue with the widely used TinyMCE Extra (the word processor-like toolbar for MODX Resources) where you cannot load Resources after Upgrading. TinyMCE by splittingred is no longer actively maintained and we recommend choosing one of the other <a href="https:/modx.com/extras/browse/?search=Tinymce" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TinyMCE Extras</a> for 2.5.1+. There is a <a href="https:/github.com/modxcms/TinyMCE/pull/20/files" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">one-line patch available</a> if you want to continue using TinyMCE. <br />
<br />
<strong>Important</strong><br />
Nearly all releases contain vital security patches. If you are using a version lower than 2.3.6 you should consider an upgrade to 2.5.1 mandatory. <br />
<br />
<strong>Security is an Ongoing Process</strong><br />
We cannot stress how important it is to run the most current version of MODX. We are always improving security. Upgrade regularly to reduce the chance of your site getting hacked. If you need help upgrading your MODX site, <a href="http://modx.com/support-and-services/maintain/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">let us know</a>. <br />

<br />
<strong>Highlights of Revolution 2.5</strong><br />
MODX Revolution 2.5 continues the tradition of enhancing functionality and performance for MODX Revolution, augmenting security, and fixing a variety of bugs. The excellent new features include the following areas:<br />
<br />
<strong>Preparing for the Future</strong><br />
MODX CMS has alway been forward thinking. We adopted PDO for database access years before others even considered it, and you could power HTML5/CSS3 mobile responsive sites with our first release in 2005, even though those technologies didn’t exist at the time. We continue this tradition with a few things that are here today, and that will be huge soon:<br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><br />
    <li>PHP 7 compatibility (it’s coming soon to a server near you). PHP 7 performs significantly faster than any previous release before it so your sites should be able to handle more visitors and serve them more quickly, keeping them engaged and returning for more.</li>
    <li>Accessibility improvements worked into the core Manager experience including screen reader and keyboard navigation on the Login screen. The work that is going on for the Accessible Manager theme that takes this much further, works in MODX Revolution 2.5, too.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Improved UX</strong><br />
<img src="https://modx.com/assets/i/blogs/ryan/25-mobile-sim-collage.png" border="0" /><br />
Our quest to improve end-user and developer experiences will never be over. To that point, the following areas received attention for 2.5:<br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><br />
    <li>New default content for new installs provides helpful resources and information. Instead of the empty blank page in all previous versions of MODX Revolution, you now get a nice intro page with some important links to assist and orient new users.</li>
    <li>Much more mobile-friendly Manager. As a stepping stone towards a new Manager in the future, this allows you to make edits and access the Manager much more easily than was possible before thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/pull/12776" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> intense efforts of JP Devries</a>.</li>
    <li>Add ability to unpack zip files in the file tree / media manager</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Developer Sugar</strong><br />
Sometimes you need to create custom functionality that available MODX Extras do not address. Often this involves creating a Custom Manager Pages and interfaces inside a Component.<br />
<br />
Previously, this required a dive into the “exciting” world of ExtJS, with which most people have a loathe-hate relationship. Now, views for applications you build into the MODX Manager are much easier to create using plain old HTML/CSS and MODX Tags. A special thanks goes to Romain Tripault and Susan Ottwell for this <a href="http://modxcookbook.com/customize-manager/cmps/cmp-made-easy.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">example of the new Custom Manager Pages in 2.5</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Faster Performance</strong><br />
Google loves fast sites, as do your visitors. MODX has always been performant when serving cached pages, now it’s even more so:<br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><br />
    <li>Parser optimizations which improve pre-caching performance. This means visitors will be served more quickly, and Google will give your site a little more respect, which it clearly deserves.</li>
    <li>The new <em>anonymous_sessions</em> setting (enabled by default) can significantly speed up the performance for sites that don’t need to have PHP sessions or logged in users. When this setting is disabled, and a page is fully cached, having sessionless anonymous visitors eliminates the need for a database connection for that visitor on each request. If your site serves even moderate traffic, this can significantly reduce the amount of processor required to operate. </li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Changes in MODX Revolution 2.5</strong><br />
Previously created sites, currently on Revolution 2.3 or above, should work when upgrading to 2.5, but we do suggest testing on an clone of your site, first. Earlier versions may take a bit of extra effort and code updates if they use non-public APIs or directly access the database.<br />
<br />
<strong>Release Contributors</strong><br />
Let’s take the time to thank the individual contributors to this release (in no particular order):John Peca, Jason Coward, Thomas Jakobi, Ronald Exterkate, Mike Reid, inreti, Zaigham Rana, Jan Tezner, Elizabeth, Romain, argnist, Anton Pastukhoff, Илья Уткин, Gildas NOEL, Ivan Klimchuk, JP DeVries, Kirill, Mark Hamstra, Mat Dave Jones, Nikolay Lanets, Sergey Shlokov, and Vasily Naumkin, along with many other contributors who log &amp; triage issues, review PRs, and commit code.
